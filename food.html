Hyderabadi Biryani exists mainly in two styles: Kacchi (raw meat cooked with rice) and Pakki (cooked meat layered with rice).</p>
                <p>Originally a royal delicacy, it has become a beloved dish across India and globally, symbolizing Hyderabad’s rich cultural heritage and culinary excellence.</p>
