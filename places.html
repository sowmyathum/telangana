                <p>The Thousand Pillar Temple is a renowned architectural marvel located in Hanamkonda, Warangal, Telangana. Built in 1163 AD by King Rudra Deva of the Kakatiya dynasty, the temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, Vishnu, and Surya, reflecting the region’s religious diversity. Its name comes from the presence of a multitude of intricately carved pillars, though not literally a thousand. The temple features a unique star-shaped (stellate) layout and is a classic example of a blend between Chalukyan and Dravidian architectural styles</p>
                <p>A highlight is the monolithic Nandi sculpture carved from a single rock, positioned in front of the temple. The temple’s pillars, doorways, and ceilings are adorned with detailed geometric patterns and exquisite carvings, showcasing the advanced craftsmanship of Kakatiya sculptors. Despite damage during invasions, restoration efforts have preserved its historical and cultural significance, making it a major tourist and heritage site in Telangana</p>
